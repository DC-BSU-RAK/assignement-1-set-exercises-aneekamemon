                    Severance is an organised surgical procedure in which a Lumon Industries employee agrees to split their work and home memories. 
                    In theory, this allows them to achieve a better work/life balance.
                    “Outies” arrive at work, take the elevator to the special severed floor, 
                    before coming-to at the end of the work day to return home.
                    “Innies” have no knowledge of who they are in the outside world, 
                    and live to work, existing only within the confines of the Lumon Industries building, 
                    from 9am to 5pm every day.
                    Ms Harmony Cobel (Patricia Arquette) works as management on the severed floor, 
                    Mr Seth Milchick (Tramell Tillman) acts as the supervisor for MDR, and Ms Casey 
                    (Dichen Lachman) is the Innies’ wellness director, offering them small glimpses to who they 
                    are as people. &nbsp;&nbsp; - RadioTimes.com

                    Severance looks beautiful and is directed with enormous sensitivity and style by Stiller. 
                    His quartet of oddball actors, Arquette (a frequent Stiller collaborator), Turturro, Walken 
                    and Tillman, elevate an already shining script and a story that is always a finely calibrated 
                    12 to 15 degrees off kilter, while the everyman quality of Scott throws the whole into perfect 
                    relief. It might be slightly slow to get going, but thereafter becomes one 
                    to savour. &nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/18/severance-review-ben-stillers-workplace-fantasy-might-make-your-mind-explode"><b>- The Guardian</b></a>
                    <br><br><br>
                    Other addictive aspects of this show are the powerful performances. Turturro’s portrayal of Irv’s haunted outtie is spellbinding and infused with heartbreak. Scott’s performance as the team leader who’s seeking answers, and perhaps even liberation from Lumon, is strikingly authentic against the fabricated, sterile environs of the office. 
                    Tillman’s slow reveal of Milchick’s hidden layers add new, captivating dimensions 
                    to a show that’s already full of them. Nuanced performances from Cherry and Lower animate 
                    the personality split between innies and outties. &nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2025-01-16/severance-season-2-review"><b>- LA Times</b></a>
                    <br><br><br>
                    With a perfect balance of the real and surreal, the show follows four employees who sort numbers floating on their computer screens at Lumon Industries, and who chose to have a chip put in their brains that cuts their memories in half. The person working inside the office, called the innie, has no knowledge of who they are beyond its walls – and their outside counterpart, or outie, has no memory of the working day. Identity crisis doesn't begin to describe it. The show's creator, Dan Erickson, was inspired by wishing that his tedious office temp 
                    job while he was a struggling screenwriter could zoom by as if it never happened, 
                    and his idea of being able to turn off your brain resonates especially well in our age 
                    of information overload. <br> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250107-severance-season-2-review"><b> - BBC</b></a>
